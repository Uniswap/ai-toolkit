# Commands (TypeScript)

## Overview

TypeScript-specific command implementations for the AI Toolkit. Provides type-safe wrappers and utilities for TypeScript-based Claude Code slash commands.

## Key Files

- `src/index.ts` - Main entry point and exports
- `src/lib/` - Command implementation modules

## Dependencies

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED - Updated by /update-claude-md -->

This package has no external dependencies (lightweight design).

## Usage

This package is imported by other workspace packages to provide TypeScript command functionality:

```typescript
import { ... } from '@ai-toolkit/commands-typescript';
```

## Development

This is a library package without build targets. Changes are consumed directly via TypeScript path mapping in the monorepo.

## Auto-Update Instructions

IMPORTANT: After changes to files in this directory or subdirectories, Claude Code MUST run `/update-claude-md` before presenting results to ensure this documentation stays synchronized with the codebase.
