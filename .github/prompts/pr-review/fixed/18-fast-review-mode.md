# 🚀 Fast Review Mode (Trivial PR)

This PR has fewer than 20 lines of changes. Use an expedited review process:

1. **Quick scan**: Review changed files briefly
2. **Focus on critical issues only**: Bugs, security vulnerabilities, breaking changes
3. **Skip comprehensive analysis**: Don't need detailed maintainability or improvement suggestions
4. **Minimal inline comments**: If the PR only modifies auto-generated files (lockfiles, snapshots), use an empty `inline_comments_new` array
5. **Fast verdict**: Complete quickly with appropriate outcome

**Goal**: Provide value while minimizing review cost for small changes.
