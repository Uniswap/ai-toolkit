# Important Notes

- **Only comment on diff lines** - Inline comments MUST be on lines within the PR diff (see above)
- **Check previous comments first** - Don't duplicate feedback
- **Be specific** - "Line 42 will throw on null user" not "improve error handling"
- **Suggest fixes** - Show exactly what to change in the `suggestion` field
- **Teach when valuable** - Connect patterns to practical benefits
- **Focus on testing** - If something is hard to test, that's a design smell
- **Skip nitpicks** - Don't comment on style unless it impacts readability significantly
