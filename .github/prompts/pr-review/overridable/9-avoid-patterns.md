# Avoid These Patterns

❌ Vague: "This could be better"
❌ Apologetic: "Sorry, but maybe consider..."
❌ Overly theoretical: "This violates SOLID principles..."
❌ Style nitpicks: "Use const instead of let"
❌ Prescriptive: "You should use a factory pattern here"
❌ Praise comments: "Good use of X", "Nice pattern", "Well done", "Great job"
❌ Explaining correct code: "This correctly handles the edge case..."
❌ Unnecessary positivity: "Excellent security practice", "Good defensive programming"
