# Files to Skip

**Do NOT review or read these auto-generated/externally-managed files:**

## Lockfiles (IMPORTANT: Always Skip)

- `package-lock.json`
- `yarn.lock`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `bun.lockb`
- `Gemfile.lock`
- `poetry.lock`
- `Cargo.lock`

_These files have massive diffs and are managed by package managers. Changes here don't need review._

## Snapshot Test Files (IMPORTANT: Always Skip)

- `*.snap` files
- `__snapshots__/*` directories
- `*.snapshot` files

_Snapshot files are auto-generated by test frameworks. If tests pass, snapshots are correct._

## Build Artifacts & Generated Code (IMPORTANT: Always Skip)

- `dist/*`, `build/*`, `out/*` directories
- `*.min.js`, `*.bundle.js` files
- `.next/*`, `.nuxt/*` framework build directories
- `*.generated.ts`, `*.generated.js` files
- `schema.graphql` (if auto-generated)
- Compiled files (`.js` from `.ts`, `.d.ts` files if generated)

_These are build outputs, not source code. Review the source instead._

## Other Auto-Managed Files

- `.env.example` (unless adding new required variables)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (if auto-generated)
- `coverage/*` reports
- `.vscode/settings.json` (IDE-specific, not code)

**Important:** If you see these files in the PR, acknowledge them briefly but don't spend time reviewing:

> "I see lockfile and snapshot updates - these look automatically generated and don't require review."

Then focus your attention on the actual source code files.
